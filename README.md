##What is this?
Simple script that takes Screenshots, reads the stats and provides a list of stats.
I plan to add a way to implement this as an addon to https://maphe.github.io/e7-damage-calc/

but that's a long way ahead. 

##TODO:
1. make the cropping work automatically 
2. resize the image so that ocr can be done offline(not really necessary)
